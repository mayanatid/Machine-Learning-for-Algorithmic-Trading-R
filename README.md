# Machine-Learning-for-Algorithmic-Trading-R
In this project, I attempt to reproduce the work done in Stefan Jansen's book "Machine Learning For Algorithmic Trading"- but instead of python, I will use R. I predict that certain areas will be more challenging than others, but I hope at the end I can come out learning some R and Algo Trading.
